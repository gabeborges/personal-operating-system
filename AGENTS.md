# SDD Subagent Index

This file indexes all subagents in the SDD (Spec-Driven Development) workflow. Each agent has a dedicated definition file in `agents/`.

| QA | Contract validation + exploratory | quality | [agents/qa.md](agents/qa.md) |
| Test Automator | Automated test implementer | quality | [agents/test-automator.md](agents/test-automator.md) |

| Security Engineer | Secure-by-design implementer | security | [agents/security-engineer.md](agents/security-engineer.md) |
| Security Auditor | Independent security reviewer | security | [agents/security-auditor.md](agents/security-auditor.md) |

## By Category

### Orchestration
- **Workflow Orchestrator** — Enforces SDD sequence, triggers agents, routes spec breaks
- **Context Manager** — Append-only decision log, resumable state

### Planning
- **Project Task Planner** — Parses OpenSpec into `tasks.md` with `implements:` pointers

### Design
- **UI Designer** — UX flows, screens, states, accessibility
- **Frontend Designer** — Component breakdown (props/states) from `ui.md`

### Implementation
- **Fullstack Developer** — Primary code writer, implements tasks with tests
- **Database Administrator** — DB Change Guardian, expand/contract migration plans

### Quality
- **QA** — Contract validation against OpenSpec schemas
- **Test Automator** — Converts acceptance checks into automated tests
- **Debugger** — Root-cause analysis, produces fix tickets
- **Code Reviewer** — PR quality gate, spec compliance verification

### Security
- **Security Engineer** — Defines secure-by-design patterns in `security.md`
- **Security Auditor** — Independent security review, OWASP checks

### Compliance
- **Compliance Engineer** — Translates compliance needs into technical requirements
- **Compliance Auditor** — Independent compliance verification

## Agent Selection Guide

| Situation | Agent to invoke |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Starting a new feature | workflow-orchestrator |
| Spec is ready, need tasks | project-task-planner |
| Feature has UI | ui-designer → frontend-designer |
| Feature has DB changes | database-administrator |
| Ready to implement | fullstack-developer |
| Implementation done, need validation | qa + test-automator |
| Tests failing | debugger |
| PR ready for review | code-reviewer |
| Security-sensitive feature | security-engineer → security-auditor |
| Compliance-sensitive feature | compliance-engineer → compliance-auditor |
| Need to record a decision | context-manager |
| Spec can't be implemented as-is | workflow-orchestrator (creates spec-change-request) |

## Swarm Orchestration

Use `/orchestrate <feature-path>` to run the full SDD build phase automatically. The workflow-orchestrator spawns agents as teammates tier-by-tier, auto-detecting which optional agents are needed from task/spec content. See [agents/swarm-config.md](agents/swarm-config.md) for the full agent↔teammate mapping and keyword triggers.
