# AGENTS.md — Agent Coordination & SDD Workflow

On-demand reference for orchestrator agents. Security and coding rules live in `CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded every session).

## SDD Artifacts (Priority Order)

Agents MUST consult these artifacts before coding:

| Priority | Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|----------|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | Product Vision (canonical) | `.ops/product-vision-strategy.md` | Full vision — cross-domain analysis only. Regenerate splits with `/vision:distill` |
| 1a | Product Vision (distilled) | `.ops/quick-product-vision-strategy.md` | Product context: vision, pillars, non-goals, AI strategy (§1–§7, §12) |
| 1b | Security/Compliance Baseline | `.ops/security-compliance-baseline.md` | Security posture, compliance, AI boundaries, tech non-goals (§10 partial, §11, §12, §15, §16) |
| 1c | Architecture Baseline | `.ops/tech-architecture-baseline.md` | Architecture, data, integration, scalability, tech non-goals (§8–§10, §12–§16) |
| 2 | UI Design System | `.ops/ui-design-system.md` | UI source of truth (if present) |
| 3 | System Design | `.ops/build/system-design.yaml` | Architecture reference |
| 4 | PRD | `.ops/build/v{x}/prd.md` | Version scope + acceptance intent |
| 5 | Specs | `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/specs.md` | Requirements + acceptance criteria (source of truth) |
| 6 | Tasks | `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/tasks.yaml` | Feature tickets with `implements:` pointers into specs |

**Do not proceed with coding if any required artifact is missing or ambiguous. Ask questions.**

### Strict Definitions
- `system-design.yaml` = architecture reference spanning multiple product versions in `.ops/build/system-design.yaml`
- `prd.md` = build level plan in `.ops/build/v{x}/prd.md`
- `implementation-status.md` = build level progress tracker in `.ops/build/v{x}/implementation-status.md`
- `specs.md` = feature requirements + acceptance criteria in `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/specs.md`
- `tasks.yaml` = feature tickets in `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/tasks.yaml`

## Workflow Discipline

### SDD Artifact Flow
Canonical order: `specs.md` (spec-writer) → `system-design.yaml` (architect) → `tasks.yaml` (project-task-planner)

**Prerequisite rules (stop conditions):**

| Artifact | Prerequisite | On Violation |
|---|---|---|
| `specs.md` | `prd.md` must exist for that version | STOP — ask user |
| `system-design.yaml` | `specs.md` must exist for that feature | STOP — run spec-writer first |
| `tasks.yaml` | Both `specs.md` AND `system-design.yaml` must exist | STOP — run architect first |

### Spec vs Implementation
- Write `specs.md` and `implementation-status.md` only in the proposal phase
- Only implement code from tasks in `tasks.yaml` (feature-level)

### Spec-Change Requests
If implementation constraints conflict with the spec:
- Create `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/spec-change-requests.yaml` (brief, factual)
- Stop and escalate to the orchestrator/user

## Stop Conditions (Ask Before Proceeding)

STOP and ask (do not guess) if:
- Target build version `v{x}` is unclear
- `prd.md` is missing and specs are about to be created
- `specs.md` is missing, contradictory, or lacks acceptance scenarios
- `system-design.yaml` is missing and tasks are about to be created (architect must run first)
- `tasks.yaml` is missing or any ticket lacks a valid `implements:` pointer
- Implementation would require changing requirements or acceptance criteria
- A security/compliance risk exists (see security rules in CLAUDE.md)
- Stripe / OAuth / Supabase settings are required but not specified

## Definition of Done

A ticket is "done" ONLY when:
- Tests pass locally (Vitest + Playwright as applicable)
- Tests added/updated for new behavior (proportional to risk)
- All relevant `specs.md` scenarios are satisfied
- Code reviewed (peer/agent reviewer per workflow)

When finishing work, report:
- What changed (files/modules)
- Which `specs.md` scenarios were satisfied (via `implements:` pointers)
- What validation was performed (commands run + outcomes)

## By Category

### Orchestration
- **Workflow Orchestrator** — Enforces SDD sequence, triggers agents, routes spec breaks
- **Context Manager** — Sole writer to decisions-log.md and implementation-status.md; records decisions, state changes, deviations

### Planning
- **Spec Writer** — Spec authoring + feature breakdown
- **Architect** — Maintains `system-design.yaml` from specs; identifies spec/architecture mismatches
- **Project Task Planner** — Parses specs into feature `tasks.yaml` with `implements:` pointers

### Design
- **UI Designer** — UX flows, screens, states, accessibility
- **Frontend Designer** — Component breakdown (props/states) from UI specs

### Implementation
- **Fullstack Developer** — Primary code writer, implements feature `tasks.yaml` with tests
- **Database Administrator** — DB change guardian, expand/contract migration plans

### Quality
- **QA** — Contract validation against `specs.md` scenarios
- **Test Automator** — Converts `specs.md` scenarios into automated tests
- **Debugger** — Root-cause analysis, produces fix tickets
- **Code Reviewer** — PR quality gate, spec compliance verification

### Security & Compliance
- **Security Engineer** — Defines secure-by-design patterns
- **Security Auditor** — Independent security review, OWASP checks
- **Compliance Engineer** — Translates compliance needs into technical requirements
- **Compliance Auditor** — Independent compliance verification

## Agent Selection Guide

| Situation | Agent to Invoke |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Starting a new feature | workflow-orchestrator |
| Spec missing/needs writing | spec-writer |
| System design needed / architecture decisions | architect |
| Spec ready, need system design before tasks | architect |
| Spec ready, need feature tasks | project-task-planner |
| Feature has UI | ui-designer → frontend-designer |
| Feature has DB changes | database-administrator |
| Ready to implement | fullstack-developer |
| Implementation done, need validation | qa + test-automator |
| Tests failing | debugger |
| PR ready for review | code-reviewer |
| Security-sensitive feature | security-engineer → security-auditor |
| Compliance-sensitive feature | compliance-engineer → compliance-auditor |
| Need to record a decision | context-manager |
| Spec can't be implemented as-is | workflow-orchestrator (creates spec-change-request) |

**UI system rule:** Before any UI work, check for `.ops/ui-design-system.md`. If missing, run `/interface-design:init`. If present, `ui-designer` and `frontend-designer` MUST follow it. Use `frontend-design` skill for simple one-off pages/components.

## Swarm Orchestration

Use `/orchestrate <feature-path>` to run the full SDD build phase automatically.

Feature workspace: `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/`

The workflow-orchestrator spawns agents tier-by-tier and auto-detects which optional agents are needed from `tasks.yaml` / `specs.md` content.
See [.claude/agents/swarm-config.md](.claude/agents/swarm-config.md) for agent-teammate mapping and keyword triggers.
