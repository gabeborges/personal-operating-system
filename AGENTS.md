# AGENTS.md — Agent Coordination & SDD Workflow

On-demand reference for orchestrator agents. Security and coding rules live in `CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded every session).

## SDD Artifacts (Priority Order)

Agents MUST consult these artifacts before coding:

| Priority | Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|----------|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | Product Vision (canonical) | `.ops/product-vision-strategy.md` | Full vision — cross-domain analysis only. Regenerate splits with `/vision:distill` |
| 1a | Product Vision (distilled) | `.ops/quick-product-vision-strategy.md` | Product context: vision, pillars, non-goals, AI strategy (§1–§7, §12) |
| 1b | Security/Compliance Baseline | `.ops/security-compliance-baseline.md` | Security posture, compliance, AI boundaries, tech non-goals (§10 partial, §11, §12, §15, §16) |
| 1c | Architecture Baseline | `.ops/tech-architecture-baseline.md` | Architecture, data, integration, scalability, tech non-goals (§8–§10, §12–§16) |
| 2 | UI Design System | `.ops/ui-design-system.md` | UI source of truth (if present) |
| 3 | System Design | `.ops/build/system-design.yaml` | Architecture reference |
| 4 | PRD | `.ops/build/v{x}/prd.md` | Version scope + acceptance intent |
| 5 | Specs | `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/specs.md` | Requirements + acceptance criteria (source of truth) |
| 6 | Tasks | `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/tasks.yaml` | Feature tickets with `implements:` pointers into specs |
| 7 | DB Migration Plan | `.ops/build/v{x}/db-migration-plan.yaml` | Build-level consolidated migration plan |
| 8 | Build Order | `.ops/build/v{x}/build-order.yaml` | Cross-feature execution ordering |

**Do not proceed with coding if any required artifact is missing or ambiguous. Ask questions.**

### Strict Definitions
- `system-design.yaml` = architecture reference spanning multiple product versions in `.ops/build/system-design.yaml`
- `prd.md` = build level plan in `.ops/build/v{x}/prd.md`
- `implementation-status.md` = build level progress tracker in `.ops/build/v{x}/implementation-status.md`
- `specs.md` = feature requirements + acceptance criteria in `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/specs.md`
- `tasks.yaml` = feature tickets in `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/tasks.yaml`
- `db-migration-plan.yaml` = build-level consolidated migration plan in `.ops/build/v{x}/db-migration-plan.yaml`
- `build-order.yaml` = cross-feature execution ordering in `.ops/build/v{x}/build-order.yaml`

## Workflow Discipline

### SDD Artifact Flow
Canonical order: `specs.md` (spec-writer) → `system-design.yaml` (architect) → `db-migration-plan.yaml` (database-administrator, build-level, if DB changes) → `tasks.yaml` (project-task-planner, per feature) → `build-order.yaml` (project-task-planner, cross-feature)

**Prerequisite rules (stop conditions):**

| Artifact | Prerequisite | On Violation |
|---|---|---|
| `specs.md` | `prd.md` must exist for that version | STOP — ask user |
| `system-design.yaml` | `specs.md` must exist for that feature | STOP — run spec-writer first |
| `db-migration-plan.yaml` | `system-design.yaml` complete AND specs contain DB keywords (build-level) | STOP — run architect first |
| `tasks.yaml` | Both `specs.md` AND `system-design.yaml` must exist | STOP — run architect first |
| `build-order.yaml` | All features' `tasks.yaml` must exist | STOP — run project-task-planner for remaining features |

### Spec vs Implementation
- Write `specs.md` and `implementation-status.md` only in the proposal phase
- Only implement code from tasks in `tasks.yaml` (feature-level)

### Spec-Change Requests
If implementation constraints conflict with the spec:
- Create `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/spec-change-requests.yaml` (brief, factual)
- Stop and escalate to the orchestrator/user

## Stop Conditions (Ask Before Proceeding)

**Execution autonomy:** Agents have full permission to create files, install dependencies, run tests/builds, commit locally, and execute commands within the project scope. The stop conditions below apply to SDD workflow decisions and architecture concerns — NOT to routine file/command operations.

**SDD workflow stops** (STOP and ask — do not guess):
- Target build version `v{x}` is unclear
- `prd.md` is missing and specs are about to be created
- `specs.md` is missing, contradictory, or lacks acceptance scenarios
- `system-design.yaml` is missing and tasks are about to be created (architect must run first)
- `tasks.yaml` is missing or any ticket lacks a valid `implements:` pointer
- Implementation would require changing requirements or acceptance criteria
- A security/compliance risk exists (see security rules in CLAUDE.md)
- Stripe / OAuth / Supabase settings are required but not specified

**Execution stops** (STOP and ask):
- Pushing to remote repositories (`git push`)
- Modifying production environments or external systems
- Destructive operations affecting shared state (see Autonomy & Execution in CLAUDE.md)

## Definition of Done

A ticket is "done" ONLY when:
- Tests pass locally (Vitest + Playwright as applicable)
- Tests added/updated for new behavior (proportional to risk)
- All relevant `specs.md` scenarios are satisfied
- Code reviewed (peer/agent reviewer per workflow)

When finishing work, report:
- What changed (files/modules)
- Which `specs.md` scenarios were satisfied (via `implements:` pointers)
- What validation was performed (commands run + outcomes)

## By Category

### Orchestration
- **Workflow Orchestrator** — Enforces SDD sequence, triggers agents, routes spec breaks
- **Context Manager** — Sole writer to decisions-log.md and implementation-status.md; records decisions, state changes, deviations

### Planning
- **Spec Writer** — Spec authoring + feature breakdown
- **Architect** — Maintains `system-design.yaml` from specs; identifies spec/architecture mismatches
- **Database Administrator** — DB change guardian, expand/contract migration plans (runs after architect, before task planner)
- **Project Task Planner** — Parses specs into feature `tasks.yaml` with `implements:` pointers

### Design
- **UI Designer** — UX flows, screens, states, accessibility, and component architecture (props/states/data requirements)

### Implementation
- **Fullstack Developer** — Primary code writer, implements feature `tasks.yaml` with tests

### Quality
- **QA** — Contract validation against `specs.md` scenarios
- **Test Automator** — Converts `specs.md` scenarios into automated tests
- **Debugger** — Root-cause analysis, produces fix tickets
- **Code Reviewer** — PR quality gate, spec compliance verification

### Security & Compliance
- **Security Agent** — Defines secure-by-design patterns (Phase 1, T3) and audits implementation against them (Phase 2, T5)
- **Compliance Agent** — Translates compliance needs into technical requirements (Phase 1, T3) and audits implementation (Phase 2, T5)

### Meta (User-Invoked Skills)
- **`/sdd:*` skill group** — Creates and audits SDD workflow configuration files, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, agent files, and skills. Invoked directly by users, not part of automated swarm. See `.claude/commands/sdd/` for available commands.

## Dependency DAG

```
Tier 1: context-manager  (lazy — invoked on triggers or at end)
   ↓
Tier 2: spec-writer → architect → database-administrator (if DB keywords) → project-task-planner  (sequential)
   ↓
Tier 3: ui-designer, security-agent (Phase 1), compliance-agent (Phase 1)  (parallel, if detected)
   ↓
Tier 4: fullstack-developer, test-automator  (parallel)
   ↓
Tier 5: qa, debugger, code-reviewer, security-agent (Phase 2), compliance-agent (Phase 2)  (parallel)
```

## Agent Selection Guide

| Situation | Agent to Invoke |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Starting a new feature | workflow-orchestrator |
| Spec missing/needs writing | spec-writer |
| System design needed / architecture decisions | architect |
| Spec ready, need system design before tasks | architect |
| Spec ready, need feature tasks | project-task-planner |
| Feature has UI | ui-designer |
| Feature has DB changes | database-administrator |
| Ready to implement | fullstack-developer |
| Implementation done, need validation | qa + test-automator |
| Tests failing | debugger |
| PR ready for review | code-reviewer |
| Security-sensitive feature | security-agent (Phase 1 → Phase 2) |
| Compliance-sensitive feature | compliance-agent (Phase 1 → Phase 2) |
| Need to record a decision | context-manager |
| Spec can't be implemented as-is | workflow-orchestrator (creates spec-change-request) |

**UI system rule:** Before any UI work, check for `.ops/ui-design-system.md`. If missing, run `/interface-design:init`. If present, `ui-designer` MUST follow it. Use `frontend-design` skill for simple one-off pages/components.

## Spec Change Request Resolution Workflow

When any agent creates `spec-change-requests.yaml`:

1. **Halt**: Workflow-orchestrator stops tier progression immediately
2. **Review**: Human or spec-writer reviews the requests in `spec-change-requests.yaml`
3. **Update specs**: `specs.md` is updated to resolve the conflicts
4. **Regenerate downstream artifacts**: Affected downstream artifacts are regenerated in order:
   - `system-design.yaml` (architect reruns if spec changes affect architecture)
   - `db-migration-plan.yaml` (database-administrator reruns if spec changes affect schema)
   - `tasks.yaml` (project-task-planner reruns to reflect updated specs/design)
5. **Resume**: Workflow resumes from the first affected tier

## Swarm Orchestration

| Command | Tiers | Use Case |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `/orchestrate:plan <path>` | T1-T2 | Planning only — specs, design, tasks |
| `/orchestrate:build <path>` | T3-T5 | Design + implement + validate |
| `/orchestrate:validate <path>` | T5 | QA + review only |
| `/orchestrate <path>` | Auto-detect | Routes based on artifact state |

Feature workspace: `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/`

The workflow-orchestrator spawns agents tier-by-tier and auto-detects which optional agents are needed from `tasks.yaml` / `specs.md` content.
See [.claude/agents/swarm-config.md](.claude/agents/swarm-config.md) for agent-teammate mapping and keyword triggers.

## Parallel Execution Strategy

Maximize throughput by parallelizing independent work at every opportunity. Use the Task tool to spawn multiple agents/tasks simultaneously.

### Within-Tier Parallelism

When a tier contains multiple agents, spawn them as parallel Task calls in a single message. Do NOT spawn sequentially if they can run simultaneously.

**Example (Tier 5):**
- Spawn `fullstack-developer` for implementation tasks
- Spawn `test-automator` for test generation
- Both run in parallel, independent of each other

### Within-Feature Task Parallelism

When implementing from `tasks.yaml`, analyze task dependencies. Tasks without `blockedBy` relationships execute in parallel.

**Example:**
- Task T-001: Implement user model (no dependencies) → start immediately
- Task T-002: Implement auth service (no dependencies) → start immediately (parallel with T-001)
- Task T-003: Implement protected routes (`blockedBy: [T-002]`) → wait for T-002
- Task T-004: Implement billing webhook (no dependencies) → start immediately (parallel with T-001, T-002)

Result: T-001, T-002, T-004 execute in parallel. T-003 waits only for T-002, NOT for T-001 or T-004.

### Cross-Feature Parallelism

When `build-order.yaml` shows independent features (no cross-dependencies), spawn separate agent instances for each feature simultaneously.

**Example:**
- Feature `user-management` (no dependencies) → spawn fullstack-developer instance
- Feature `billing` (no dependencies) → spawn separate fullstack-developer instance (parallel)
- Feature `analytics` (`depends_on: [user-management]`) → wait for user-management completion

### Blocker Handling

If one parallel branch hits a blocker (needs user input, spec ambiguity, missing prerequisite), flag it clearly and continue ALL other branches. Never wait idle.

**Pattern:**
1. Agent A blocks on missing UI spec → flag: "A blocked: needs ui.md", continue B and C
2. Agent B completes → report completion, continue C
3. Agent C blocks on user decision → flag: "C blocked: needs user input on X"
4. Return status: "B complete. A blocked (needs ui.md). C blocked (needs user input on X)."

### Task Tool Usage Examples

**Parallel tier execution (Tier 5):**
```
TaskCreate(task_id="implement-features", agent="fullstack-developer", workspace="...")
TaskCreate(task_id="generate-tests", agent="test-automator", workspace="...")
// Both run simultaneously
```

**Parallel task execution (within feature):**
```
TaskCreate(task_id="T-001", agent="fullstack-developer", instructions="Implement user model")
TaskCreate(task_id="T-002", agent="fullstack-developer", instructions="Implement auth service")
TaskCreate(task_id="T-004", agent="fullstack-developer", instructions="Implement billing webhook")
// T-003 spawned later with blockedBy=["T-002"]
```

**Blocker bypass:**
```
// T-001 blocks on user input
TaskUpdate(task_id="T-001", status="blocked", note="Needs user clarification on X")
// Continue with T-002, T-004 (independent tasks) immediately — do NOT wait
```
