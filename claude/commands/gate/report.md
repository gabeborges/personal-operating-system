description: Unified gate status report — aggregates all checks.yaml sections for a feature
---

# Gate Report

Aggregates all gate results from `checks.yaml` for a feature workspace. Shows which gates passed, which failed, and whether the feature is ready to merge.

---

## Usage

```
/gate:report .ops/build/v1/user-auth
```

**Arguments**: Path to feature workspace (e.g., `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>`)

---

## Required Reading

Before running this command, understand the gate schema:

1. `.claude/skills/sdd-protocols/SKILL.md` — checks.yaml schema, gate sections, status values
2. `.claude/agents/instructions.md` — SDD tier structure, validation gates

---

## checks.yaml Schema

Based on `.claude/skills/sdd-protocols/SKILL.md`, `checks.yaml` has these sections:

| Section | Written By | Schema |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| `db_migration` | database-administrator | `status`, `blockers`, `notes` |
| `ui_design` | ui-designer | `status`, `blockers`, `notes` |
| `security_review` | security-agent (Phase 1) | `status`, `blockers`, `notes` |
| `compliance_review` | compliance-agent (Phase 1) | `status`, `blockers`, `notes` |
| `qa_validation` | qa | `status`, `blockers`, `notes`, `evidence` |
| `testing` | test-automator | `status`, `blockers`, `notes`, `evidence` |
| `code_review` | code-reviewer | `status`, `blockers`, `notes`, `evidence` |
| `security_audit` | security-agent (Phase 2) | `status`, `blockers`, `notes`, `evidence` |
| `compliance_audit` | compliance-agent (Phase 2) | `status`, `blockers`, `notes`, `evidence` |

**Status values**: `pass` | `fail`

---

## Report Steps

### Step 1: Read checks.yaml

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to get feature workspace path: `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>`
2. Read `checks.yaml` from `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/checks.yaml`
3. If file doesn't exist, report: "No gate results found. Gates have not run yet."

### Step 2: Parse Gate Sections

For each gate section in `checks.yaml`:

1. Extract `status` (pass/fail)
2. Extract `blockers` (list of blocking issues)
3. Extract `notes` (non-blocking observations)
4. Extract `evidence` (file references, if present)

### Step 3: Aggregate Results

Count:
- Total gates (how many sections exist)
- Passed gates (`status: pass`)
- Failed gates (`status: fail`)
- Missing gates (expected section not present)

### Step 3a: Check Tier 3 Artifacts and Build-Level Artifacts

In addition to `checks.yaml` sections, aggregate status from these sources:

1. **ui_design** — Check if `ui.md` exists in the feature workspace
   - If present: report artifact status and check if `checks.yaml` has a `ui_design:` section
   - If `ui.md` exists but `ui_design:` section missing from `checks.yaml`: report as INCOMPLETE

2. **security_review** — Check if `security.yaml` exists in the feature workspace
   - If present: report artifact status and check if `checks.yaml` has a `security_review:` section
   - If `security.yaml` exists but `security_review:` section missing from `checks.yaml`: report as INCOMPLETE

3. **compliance_review** — Check if `compliance.yaml` exists in the feature workspace
   - If present: report artifact status and check if `checks.yaml` has a `compliance_review:` section
   - If `compliance.yaml` exists but `compliance_review:` section missing from `checks.yaml`: report as INCOMPLETE

4. **build_order** — Check if `build-order.yaml` exists at `.ops/build/v{x}/build-order.yaml`
   - This is a build-level artifact (NOT per-feature)
   - If multiple feature directories exist under `.ops/build/v{x}/` and `build-order.yaml` is missing: report as WARNING
   - If present: report build order and feature sequencing

5. **db_migration** — Reference points to build-level `.ops/build/v{x}/db-migration-plan.yaml`
   - This is a build-level artifact (NOT per-feature)
   - Check at `.ops/build/v{x}/db-migration-plan.yaml`, not inside the feature workspace

### Step 4: Determine Overall Verdict

**Merge Ready**: All gates present and `status: pass`
**Blocked**: One or more gates have `status: fail`
**Incomplete**: One or more expected gates missing

**Blockers**:
1. Pagination: nextCursor is null instead of absent (T-004 created)
**Notes**:
- Contract check: GET /users response matches UserList schema
**Evidence**:
- `src/routes/users.ts`

---

### ✅ Code Review
**Status**: PASS
**Blockers**: None
**Notes**:
- Response matches UserList schema
- Cursor pagination works
**Evidence**:
- `src/routes/users.ts`

---

### ❌ Security Audit

## Summary

### Gates Passed (4)
- ✅ db_migration
- ✅ testing
- ✅ code_review
- ✅ compliance_audit

### Gates Failed (2)
- ❌ qa_validation
- ❌ security_audit

### Gates Missing (0)
- None

---

## Blockers List

**Total Blockers**: 2

1. **QA Validation** (qa)
   - Pagination: nextCursor is null instead of absent (T-004 created)

2. **Security Audit** (security-agent Phase 2)
   - SEV-2: Missing input length validation on user.name (src/routes/users.ts:23)

---

## Overall Verdict

**Status**: BLOCKED

**Why**: 2 gates have failing status with blockers

**What's Needed**:
1. Fix blocker: T-004 (QA validation — pagination response)
2. Fix blocker: SEV-2 input validation (Security audit — user.name validation)
3. Re-run qa and security-agent (Phase 2) to verify fixes
4. Once all gates pass, feature is merge ready

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Address T-004: Fix pagination response in `src/routes/users.ts`
2. Address SEV-2: Add input length validation for user.name in `src/routes/users.ts`

**After Fixes**:
1. Re-run `/gate:report` to verify all gates pass
2. If all pass, proceed with merge
```

---

## Special Cases

### No checks.yaml
If `checks.yaml` doesn't exist, report:
```
Status: INCOMPLETE
Reason: No gate results found
Next Steps: Run validation agents (Tier 5) to generate gate results
```

### Partial checks.yaml
If only some sections exist (e.g., only `qa_validation` and `testing`), report:
```
WARNING: Incomplete gate coverage
Missing gates: db_migration, code_review, security_audit, compliance_audit
Recommendation: Run all Tier 5 agents before merging
```

### All Gates Pass
If all sections have `status: pass`, report:
```
Status: MERGE READY ✅

All validation gates passed. Feature is ready to merge.

Final Checklist:
- [ ] All blockers resolved
- [ ] All gates re-run and passing
- [ ] No open spec change requests
- [ ] Implementation status updated
```

## Gate Expectations

Expected gates (based on `.claude/skills/sdd-protocols/SKILL.md`):

1. **db_migration** — required if feature touches database schema; references build-level `.ops/build/v{x}/db-migration-plan.yaml`
2. **ui_design** — required if `ui.md` exists in feature workspace (UI keywords detected)
3. **security_review** — required if `security.yaml` exists in feature workspace (security keywords detected)
4. **compliance_review** — required if `compliance.yaml` exists in feature workspace (compliance keywords detected)
5. **build_order** — required if build version has multiple feature directories; references build-level `.ops/build/v{x}/build-order.yaml`
6. **qa_validation** — always required (contract validation)
7. **testing** — always required (test coverage)
8. **code_review** — always required (quality gate)
9. **security_audit** — always required (vulnerability scan)
10. **compliance_audit** — required if feature handles PHI/PII

**Missing Gates Detection**:
- If `.ops/build/v{x}/db-migration-plan.yaml` exists but `db_migration` section missing → report as MISSING
- If `ui.md` exists but `ui_design` section missing from `checks.yaml` → report as MISSING
- If `security.yaml` exists but `security_review` section missing from `checks.yaml` → report as MISSING
- If `compliance.yaml` exists but `compliance_review` section missing from `checks.yaml` → report as MISSING
- If `compliance.yaml` exists but `compliance_audit` section missing from `checks.yaml` → report as MISSING
- If multiple features in build and `build-order.yaml` missing → report as WARNING
