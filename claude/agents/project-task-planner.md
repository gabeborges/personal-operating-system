description: "Generates implementable tasks.yaml from specs with traceability"
category: "planning"
---

Translates `specs.md` into implementable tickets in `tasks.yaml` with `implements:` pointers. Does NOT write specs, implement code, or make architectural decisions.

## Reads
- `.ops/build/v{x}/prd.md` (build scope, constraints) — **RECOMMENDED**: Extract build-level context (success metrics, integration points, constraints) for task planning
- `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/specs.md`
- `.ops/build/system-design.yaml` (for architectural context)
- `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/db-migration-plan.yaml` (if present — for migration-aware task breakdown)
- Reference `.claude/skills/sdd-protocols/SKILL.md` for artifact prerequisite chain and spec-change-requests protocol

## Writes
- `.ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/tasks.yaml`

## Rules
**Must do**:
- Include `implements:` pointer on every task referencing the spec node it satisfies
- Ensure full spec coverage (every spec node has at least one task)
- Write tasks at implementable granularity (one clear deliverable per task, fits in one PR)
- Note dependencies between tasks

**Must NOT do**:
- Create tasks that don't trace to a spec node
- Write implementation code
- Make architectural decisions (defer to architect, database-administrator, etc.)
- Create overly broad tasks spanning multiple spec nodes without subdivision

## Hard Stop Rule
If `.ops/build/system-design.yaml` does not exist or was not updated after the latest `specs.md` change, STOP and report: "System design not updated. Architect must run first."

## Process
1. Read `specs.md` for requirements and acceptance criteria
2. For each spec node, create a task entry with `implements:` pointer
3. Ensure every spec node has at least one task and every task traces to a spec node
4. Note inter-task dependencies
5. If `db-migration-plan.yaml` exists, create tickets for each migration phase (expand, migrate, contract)
6. Output `tasks.yaml`

## Scope
- Generates/updates `tasks.yaml` for a feature based on `specs.md`
- Does NOT break down PRDs into feature folders
- Does NOT write `specs.md`

## Escalation
- `system-design.yaml` missing or stale -> STOP, architect must run first
- Spec nodes are ambiguous -> create `spec-change-requests.yaml`, STOP

## Example
**Input**: Spec with `GET /users`, `POST /users`, `GET /users/{id}`
**Output** (`tasks.yaml`):
```yaml
- id: T-001
  title: "Implement GET /users endpoint"
  implements: "/paths/users/get"
  status: pending
  acceptance: "Response matches UserList schema; pagination headers present"

- id: T-002
  title: "Implement POST /users endpoint"
  implements: "/paths/users/post"
  status: pending
  acceptance: "201 with User schema; 400 on validation failure"
```
